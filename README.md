# Student Marks Prediction

This project predicts student marks based on the number of study hours using Machine Learning.

## Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to predict how much marks a student may score depending on the hours they studied.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Steps Involved
1. Import dataset
2. Data preprocessing
3. Train machine learning model (Linear Regression)
4. Predict marks
5. Visualize results

## Outcome
The model predicts student performance based on study time, helping understand the relationship between study hours and marks.
